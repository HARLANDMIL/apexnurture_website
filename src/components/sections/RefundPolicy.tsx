                    <strong>Non-Refundable:</strong> One-time build fees for our AI automation suites 
                    (e.g., LeadGen Suite, Full Automation Suite) are non-refundable once work has 
                    commenced. This is due to the custom nature of our Services, which are tailored 
                    specifically to your business needs.

                    <strong>Exception â€“ "Build in 7 Days or It's Free" Guarantee:</strong> If we fail 
                    to deliver your suite within the promised timeline (e.g., 7 days for most suites) 
                    due to our sole fault, and not due to delays caused by you (e.g., unresponsiveness, 
                    incomplete information), you may be eligible for a full refund of the one-time build 
                    fee. To request this, contact us within 14 days of the missed deadline.
